# Handshake-Problem-Visualized
The handshake problem asks how many handshakes happen if everyone in a group shakes hands with everyone else once. If there are "n" people, the total number of handshakes is n(n-1)/2. This just means that each person shakes hands with every other person once, and we count all those handshakes.
